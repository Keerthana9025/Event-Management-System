**Event Management System**
**Objective:**

   Create a backend system using Java, Spring Boot, and PostgreSQL to manage events, sessions, and participants.
   
**Key Requirements:**
  **1) Implement APIs to perform CRUD operations for:**
    
        i) Events (title, description, date, location, category)
        ii)Sessions within each event (topic, speaker, start time, end time)
        
  **2)Session materials limited to:**
  
       i) PDF documents (e.g., speaker slides, agendas)
       ii)Video links (e.g., recorded sessions, promo videos)
Allow filtering events by category or date.
Support participant registration for events via APIs.

**Include endpoints to:**

    i)    Add, update, delete, and list events, sessions, and materials
    ii)   Register participants and list their registered events
    iii)  Thoroughly test with unit and integration tests.
    iv)   (Optional) Add an endpoint to generate a PDF schedule for a specific event.
